    "In this notebook we expose the design, implementation, and complexity analysis of a Turing Machine that determines if a given number belongs to the Fibonacci sequence. The well-known Fibonacci sequence, commonly denoted $F_n$, is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two previous ones. The sequence generally starts with \"1\" and \"1\", and follows with the sum of these two numbers: 1 + 1 = 2. The first four numbers of the sequence are then $0,1,1,2$, and the next one is computed by adding \"1\" and “2\". We can easily find a recurrence formula:\n",
    "\t\n",
    "  $$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is valid for $n>1$. As the numbers get larger, the quotient between each successive pair of Fibonacci numbers approximates to 1.618. This proportion is known by “golden ratio”, or $\\phi$. By operating the recurrent formula successively, we obtain the infinite Fibonacci sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_n = 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 ... $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Some mathematicians exclude the “0” from the sequence, starting it with the number “1”. For practical reasons, we have also excluded the “0”, whose absence does not affect the overall analysis of our Turing Machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also determine if a given number $n$ belongs to the Fibonacci sequence by checking if one of the following expressions gives as a result a perfect square:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$5n^2+4 \\hspace{0.5cm},\\hspace{0.5cm} 5n^2-4$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Fibonacci sequence astonishing presence in nature, points out its important role in the behavior and formation of many features in the Universe. Emergent patterns and ratios can be observed from the microscale to the macroscale; for example, the numbers of petals in a flower, the splitting of tree branches, animal fight patterns, the spiral galaxies shape … they are all Fibonacci numbers or follow the Fibonacci pattern.\n"

For this reason, we need two different subroutines, which perform essentialy the same task, with the difference that they sum 'towards the right' or 'towards the left'.

    "We can see a special behaviour in our data points: for certain consecutive numbers, the number of steps that the Turin Machine needs to determine whether the number N belongs to the FS is almost the same (diverging only by one step). This behaviour can be explained as follows: the difference of steps needed to halt the machine for a number $n$ belonging to the FS, is notably smaller than the number of steps needed for the immediate following number $n+1$ (which in general does not belong to FS), since the addition subroutine must be run at least once more for $n+1$. On the other hand, for the immediate following number of a non-belonging N, there is only one step difference, since the addition subroutine is used the same amount of times; we simply need one more step to compare the input number and the Fibonacci number of the additional tape. \n",

Notice that this is the case for number $8$ as $5\\cdot8^2 + 4 = 324$, which is a perfect square. Thus, we can see how the number of iterations needed to calculate the formula is less than what is expected.The same happens with number $3$.\n",

In the plots we can appreciate that, when increasing the input length N, the number of steps needed to halt the machine scales more rapidly in the case of the binary TM in comparison with the unary TM. Nevertheless, for a specific number k, the binary TM gives a better performance in comparision to the unary TM. That is, the binary TM needs less steps than the unary TM to determine if a number k (expressed in binary and unary respectively) belongs to the Fibonacci sequence.\n",
